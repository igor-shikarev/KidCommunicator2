She is a special need child (she can understand but can't speak) so i created this program to help parents of such children to improve communication with them and for better understanding of child's needs. If you have any comments or suggestions regarding this program please contact me via email: <strong><a href="mailto:igor.shikarev@gmail.com">igor.shikarev@gmail.com</a></strong>.
